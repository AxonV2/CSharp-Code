# CSharp-Code
This is where I keep code snippets and programs. 

I also have my [Java android project](https://github.com/AxonV2/YouCook-AndroidProject) if you're interested in more.


#### Kotlin Calculator 
Simple calculator made using Android Studio, a couple of exercises in here but what you really want is Calculator.kt.
Tried to keep everything as simple and readable as possible. All the other exercises are just me testing and messing with stuff.


#### Class Library
This is the class library I usually include in all my test programs.

What I want to show you here is the static class 'Tools', this is where I include code that I tend to use quite a bit.

The other half of this library is just a, very messy, testing ground where I test things like:

    Generics
    Async methods
    Delegates
    Lambdas
    Overloads
    LINQ...


#### First Project
My first ever 'real' project, code wise, an absolute mess that doesn't run or look nice.Inside you'll find the database I used and its diagram.

Built with an MVC architectural pattern, it simulates an admin program for a public transport system (Buses).

The user can: add buses and stops, connect a bus to a stop at a certain time and day, and search through the database with a nice amount of filters.   


#### Hashing and Algorithms, Linked List, Selection + Bubble Sort
Simple console applications where I tested these couple of concepts:

	Hashing - Manually inserting and searching from a hashed array.
	Linked List - Manually inserting and removing from a linked list.
	Selection/Bubble sort - Adding, searching, removing and editing from a bubble and selection sorted list.


#### WFP Async Reference
Two Async test applications where a speed comparison is made between async and non-async methods.

The Async reference program uses cancellation tokens for a cancel button and a progress reporter for a progress bar.

#### WFP Abstractions, Inheritance
My most recent program, I made sure to stick to SOLID principles and make everything as readable as possible, includes:

	Abstractions
	Method Overloading
	Constructor Chaining 
	Generic usage
	SOLID Adherence
